== Introduction

TuitionConnect (TC) is an integration of a personalised address book, task manager and income tracker for private home tutors. +

Stems from our strong passion in simplifying the life of tutors, TuitionConnect introduces features
to aid management of tutee contacts, tuition schedule and income tracking. Moreover, we believe that a thorough connectivity is the
root of simplicity. Hence, there are also features which support the management of your personal contacts and tasks. +

TuitionConnect is primarily for tutors who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts and tasks*.
More importantly, TuitionConnect is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface*
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). +

With TuitionConnect's keyboard shortcuts and productive features, TuitionConnect can get your contact and task management done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested?
Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Concepts Introduction
* Contact : This refers to both the tutee and person.
* Tutee  : This refers to the students you are teaching. Adding a student as tutee requires specific *tutee details* to be provided.
         By doing so, it will be easier to organize your contacts using our special features. +
* Person : Other contacts which are not tutee. +
* Tutee Details : These are details that are only owned by tutees, which include tutee's education level, grade, subject and school. +
* Task : This refers to the activities you want to add into your 'to-do-list'. +
Type of Task: +
. Tuition task: Teaching a specified tutee in contact list. +
. Personal task: Non-tuition activity.
* Address Book : This refers to the list of contacts located on the most left side of the app.
* Task List / Schedule : these terms are used interchangeably to refer to the list of tasks located in the middle of the app.
