== Introduction

TuitionConnect (TC) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts*. More importantly, TC is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TC can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
